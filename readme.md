// Program for creating a DataBase Application with HTML,PHP,JavaScript,MySQL,LaravelPHPFrameWork

// First I put the default structure for the document which is the same for any other HTML page

// In the title tag I mention the type of the program version

// Afterward the php skelet is constructed in echo format and printing the items 

// Use of the for cycle to increment the year by one

// The structure is designed to print the $query parameter in sql syntax 

// Also on display is the sql syntax for output of the php requirements

// The while cycle is needed to contain the items needed to output the result

// The $query variable is used to store the information needed for the program

// At the end of the document, I wrap the document with the table and ?> tag to close the PHP document

// The body and html tags are needed to ensure the document is php format
